[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mure-apps/mure-library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mure-apps/mure-library)

The Javascript integration library for the mure ecosystem of apps

Currently in development; ultimately, this will be a library that people can use
to create their own mure web editors / tools. Its goal is to standardize synced (via PouchDB / CouchDB) graphics, selection, and metadata changes between any other open mure apps.

As specific types of metadata (embedded datasets, bindings, etc) become standardized
across apps, some core functionality associated with that metadata may be
absorbed here as well.

Installation
============

```
npm install mure
```
or
```
<script src="https://mure-apps.github.io/mure-library/dist/mure.cjs.js"></script>
```

Usage
